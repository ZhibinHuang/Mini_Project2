# Mini_Project2

1. This is a project for building a CNN model to predict a photo if it is a car or a bus. By using python3 and tensorflow, dataset from MIO-TCD dataset: http://podoce.dinf.usherbrooke.ca/challenge/dataset/. 

2. The photos of training set is 1328 and testing set is 332. The batch size is 32, image size is 64*64*3 by pre-processing from the photos. The validation rate is 0.2 and the drop-out rate is 0.3 in the model.

3. The sturcture of the model is shown below:
